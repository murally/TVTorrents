INTRODUCTION
------------

Hi there!

You've landed on this page, and are reading this README cos you're interested probably in TV shows and torrents.
I wanted to 
	a. experiment with Python
	b. Automate my TV series downloads

and hence this small project.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

I wanna list down all the dependencies here:

	* BitTorrent with Web API enabled
	* A calendar subscription with 'www.next-episode.net'
	* Python 2.7

HOW IT WORKS
------------

You run the script, it connects to the calendar, downloads a copy of it to your local computer, parses it, checks what TV shows are on today, and for each of those shows, adds a torrent into BitTorrent. A query is made to isohunt.com to get torrent listings in JSON, sorted on size, and only torrents between 100 and 400 MB are used. 

TODO
----

Make sure that variables are separated out into a different module. Current variables/parameters include:
	
	Location of downloaded calendar .ics file
	Torrent query URL
	Download size limits, max and min
	BitTorrent Web API URL
	
Make sure that erroneous torrents aren't downloaded. Right now there's no way to verify whether a torrent is legit or not, must try to do something about that.
Currently filtering is only based on size.
